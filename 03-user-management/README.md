# User Management in Linux

## Introduction to User Management in Linux
Linux is a multi-user operating system, meaning multiple users can operate on a system simultaneously. Proper user management ensures security, controlled access, and system integrity. 

Key files involved in user management:
- `/etc/passwd` – Stores user account details.
- `/etc/shadow` – Stores encrypted user passwords.
- `/etc/group` – Stores group information.
- `/etc/gshadow` – Stores secure group details.

## Creating Users in Linux
To create a new user in Linux, use:

### `useradd` Command (For most Linux distributions)
```bash
useradd username
```
This creates a user without a home directory.

To create a user with a home directory:
```bash
useradd -m username
