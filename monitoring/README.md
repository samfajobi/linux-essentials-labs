# Linux System Monitoring

## Introduction to System Monitoring
Monitoring system resources is essential to ensure optimal performance, detect issues, and troubleshoot problems in Linux. Various tools allow us to monitor CPU, memory, disk usage, network activity, and running processes.

## Index of Commands Covered

### CPU and Memory Monitoring
- `top` – Real-time system monitoring
- `htop` – Interactive process viewer (requires installation)
- `vmstat` – Report system performance statistics
- `free -m` – Show memory usage

### Disk Monitoring
- `df -h` – Check disk space usage
- `du -sh /path` – Show disk usage of a specific directory
- `iostat` – Display CPU and disk I/O statistics

### Network Monitoring
- `ifconfig` – Show network interfaces (deprecated, use `ip a`)
- `ip a` – Show network interface details
- `netstat -tulnp` – Show active connections and listening ports
- `ss -tulnp` – Alternative to `netstat` for socket statistics
- `ping hostname` – Test network connectivity
- `traceroute hostname` – Show network path to a host

### Log Monitoring
- `tail -f /var/log/syslog` – Live monitoring of system logs
- `journalctl -f` – Live system logs for systemd-based distros
- `dmesg | tail` – View kernel logs

## CPU and Memory Monitoring
